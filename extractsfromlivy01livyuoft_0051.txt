II. THE TABLES ARE TURNED ΟΝ THE ROMANS. 37

1. 170. pareatur, impersonal.

1. 171. armis. ablative of price, ‘ by the surrender of arms?

l. 17 5. There were no fetiales with the army ; sor the Romans had re·
solved to make no peace with the Samnites. The fetiales (¹ sor, sari) φημί)
were the guardians osnational morality. caerimonia, ‘ due solemnities.'

1. 176. The consuls and all the commanders pledged their word of
honour that the people would ratify the peace; and until then the
equites, the sons of the most distinguished families, were to remain as
hostages. In contradistinction to this, it will be remembered that in
the capitulation of Sedan the Emperor Napoleon specially stated that
he had no wish or power to bind the Home Goverument in making his
capitulation.

Claudius. Appius Claudius Caecus, the earliest Roman writer in
prose or verse whose name we know. He began the Via Appia. He
it was also who induced the senate to reject the treaty with Pyrrhus.

l. 177. per sponsionem, ‘by pledging their word on oath.’ It is
diffieult to make out from Livy's account what they pledged their word
to do. See 1. 326 and note. If they only promised to urge the accep-
tance of the peace proposed, Postumius certainly broke his word, as
we see in 1. 275. If, on the other hand, they actually concluded a peace
‘per sponsionem,' they tried to exceed their powers. And even then
the question remains, Why were the tribunes of the plebs responsible?
For they of course were not now with the army.

1. 180. See note on 1. 137.

per quem populum, &c. ‘The relative clause in Latin osten
precedes the antecedent, when greater force is gained by the trans-
position; when the emphasis is thrown on the demonstrative; and when
the relative refers to a demonstrative which stands alone.’ Potts.

The order of the sentence will be as follows, ‘ Res transigitur
precatione, ut Iuppiter ita eum populum feriat per quem fiat quo minus
legibus dictis stetur, quemadmodum porcus a fetialibus feriatur?
Translate, ‘ The whole matter is simply a prayer that the nation which
interferes with the terms laid down may be struck by Jupiter, just in the
same way as the pig is struck by the fenals!

l. 181. spoponderunt, ‘there plighted their oath,' &c-

1. 182. legati. ‘In addition to the regular officers of the legion,
a general or provincial governor usually nominated, with the consent of
the senate, legati, i. e. lieutenant-generals who were not attached to
any one corps, but also exercised a general superintendence under his
orders when he was present, and acted as his representatives when he
was absent. We hear of legati under consuls and dictators from
a very early period ; the number seems to have been originally two, one
sor each os the two legions which constituted a Consularis Exercitus,
