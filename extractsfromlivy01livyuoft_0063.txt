IV. FRESH APPEAL TO MIGHT.

The Roman government had thus reaped all the advantages of the
treaty of Caudium, but refused to fulfil its conditions. In such a case
either the legions ought to have been replaced in their desperate position,
or some compromise, at any rate, ought to have been offered which the
Samnites could have accepted. But, whether owing to the fanaticism of
Roman national feeling, or to the want os perseverance which the Sam-
nites always show in their negotiations‚ neither of these alternatives was
adopted. A fresh appeal is made to the god of war, and he decides for
the stronger. Nothing can be more complete than the Roman successes
as recorded here by Livy.

l. 460. forsitan . . . fide, ‘possibly released from all national, at any

· rate from all private, obligation.'

l. 461. ab. Cf. 1. 236, n.

Samnitibus must be construed as subject. ‘ The Samnites, feeling
that, &c., not only imagined all the Subsequent events in their minds,
but almost saw thern with their eyes, and only too late came to praise
either of the old man‘s alternatives.'

1. 462. infestus (cp. ‘manifestus‚' ‘festin0‘), old participle of ‘infero‚’
distinguished from ‘ infensus‚' as outward opposition is from inward un·
friendliness. cf. Liv. ii. 6 ‘In ipsum infestus consulem infenso animo
concurrit:

l. 465. inter quae media. Madvig thinks that ⁴ to fall between the
middle of two plans' is nonsense, and has very ingeniously restored ‘ via’
before ‘vic-toriae: sor ‘media ’ to agree with. The similarity of letters
makes it a very plausible suggestion. ‘ Inter medios hostes' is simple
enough, where the expression is used of being in the midst of one body;
cp. ‘per medios hostes,' and so ‘ medio tutissimus ibis ’ of passing between
two bodies, but the combination ⁴ inter media' referring to two distinct
objeets is unusual.

1. 468. potuerint. Translate, ‘Whom they might either have swept
away for ever as soes or have secured for ever as friends?

1. 4'69. inclinatis, ‘ made to totter,· ‘ impaired.’

l. 470. mutaverant, intransitive.

1. 472. geri posse bellum, ‘the possibility of war.' The pupil
should notice every means for avoiding abstract words in Latin prose.
In the minds of the Romans the mere possibility of war was equivalent
to certain victory.

l. 473. simul. Translate, ‘ The Samnites thought that to the Romans
the renewal of war was the same thing as vietory.‘

1. 475. Compare l. 49, n. Mommsen thinks the following events histo·
