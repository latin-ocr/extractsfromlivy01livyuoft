III. THE RETURN OF THE CONQUERED. 45

on the uses to which religion could be put among the Romans, and
that a man os Livy's genius and culture should venture upon it, indi-
cates what Roman ‘gravitas' was really worth.

l. 364. neo followed by ‘ et,’ as before. 1. 147.

1. 365. When dum denotes what happens while (and so because)
something else happens, it usually takes the present, even in past time.
‘ Whilst they scarce dared to trust the very scene os their victory, but
hastened to disarm,’ διε.

l. 367. an. Here again notice that ‘ an ’ really gives the second side
of a double question, being practically equivalent to ‘ Unless you are
prepared to assent!

si sana mens fuisset. We may supply—‘ if they knew with what
dishonest villains they were dealing.’
. l. 368. fuit. For indicative in apodosis, compare Hor. Od. ii. 17. 27:

” ‘Me truncus illapsus cerebro
Sustulerat‚ nisi Faunus ictum
Dextra levasset)

dum, ‘ in the same time that.’ Contrast with use of ‘ dum‚’ l. 365.

accersunt. ‘ Arcesso.‘ ‘ capesse,‘ ‘lacesso‚' ‘ petess0,' ‘quaero,‘ all
form their perfect in ‘ -sivi.' They are probably desideratives, like
δρασείω.

1. 37ο. See note on 1. 207.

l. 372. certam, ‘ no longer doubtful)

es. demum . . . spopondissemus, ‘then only there was likely
to have been a pledge, to which we should have pledged our words
with the consent of the people.'

1. 374. nee fas fuit, ⁶ nor was it ordained.‘ He wishes to convince
his audience that the gods had so arranged matters that the oaths sworn
in their name should be null and void.

l. 375. laetiore, ‘ too enchanting for their minds to grasp.’

1.. 377. eadem, i. e. the impulsive movements of the enemy.

l. 378. vanam, ‘illusory.'

l. 381. appellare (cs. 1. 425), ‘to summons‚’ ‘ have a case against)

L 385'. Samnitibus . . . rei . . . animos, ‘to the Samnites we are
bound by oath, as debtors quite able to discharge our debt regarding
that which is ours to pay, that for which we are fairly responsible, our
own bodies and lives.’

l. 386. reus. Compare, ‘voti reus} ‘bound by my vow.’

⁴ Reus dictus est a re, quam promisit ac debet.

Reus promittendo oet qui suo nomine alteri quid pro altero promisit.'
locuples, ‘ wealthy,’ ‘ trustworthy.¹ Cf. ‘locuples testis!
in id, as ‘ in omnia,' l. 354: sor ‘ sponsores ' implies ‘ obligatio.’
l. 387. For this sense of praestare compare Cic. de Or. ². 28
