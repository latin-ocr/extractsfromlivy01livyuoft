‘ Impetus populi praestare nemo potest‚’ ‘ No one can be held answer-
able for the outbreaks of the people.'

l. 389. praesens, ‘immediate’

1. 391. luendae sponsioni. The MSS. here have the genitive, but
as that could not depend on ‘ capita ' or ‘ feramus‚' being only used aster
the verb ⁴ sum,’ Madvig reads the dative. Compare iii. 5. 14 ‘ His aver-
tendis terroribus feriae indictae,' and such expressions as ‘decemviri
legibus scribendis,⁷ ‘ curator muris reficiundis.' But ‘eoncordia dis-
solvendae tribuniciae potestatis est,’ v. 5.

1. 393. eausa (cf. ‘causor,' the F rench causer), ‘ subject of speech.'
Some derive it from ‘ caveo,’ as a passive participle feminine, like

noxa ’ srom ‘noceo.'

1. 394. ut . . . fore potestate, ‘that they would submit to.' ‘ Esse,‘
‘ habere‚’ and ‘ res ' are words which can ‚only be translated with close re-
ference to the context. Their general use illustrates the simplicity of the
Latin language‚ which prefers such words to more complex expressions.

l. 395. Compare with extemplo (⁸ ex tempore ’) ‘ coram‚’ probably
for c'oram=mrr‘ ὄμμα, ‘ co'minus (manus],' ‘illico (in loco).'

1. 397. quaedam, used to express a figure. ‘ A kind of light seemed
to have dawned upon the state.' Cf. ‘ prima spes affulsit!

l. 398. in ore, elsewhere with the word ‘ omnium'3 ‘ in everybody's
mouth.' Cf. ‘volito vivu’ per ora virum.’

1. 400. For aequabant eum devotioni, compare Cic. ‘ Oratio cum
maioribus nostris conserenda? Notice the oratio obliqua with the verb
of saying omitted.

obnoxius, declared guilty and brought up sor punishment:
idiomatically, ‘at the mercy of,’ as in line 195.

l. 403. Compare x. 8. 10 ⁴ En unquam fando audistis ἓ ’ It must always
be borne in mind that the questions which in the oratio directa occur in
the indicative are expressed obliquely by the acc. with ins. if the first or
third person was employed in the directa. So ⁸ An quicquam superbius
esse? ³ But ‘ Cur progrederentur ἲ ’ ⁸ Why are you advancing? '

The saet is that, as Dr. Abbott remarks, ᾖ 78 a, p. 101 of his Latin
prose, questions asked about oneself or about an absent person are very
often asked not for information but to express emotion. ⁴Hence perhaps
the difference between indirect questions with the second person on the
one hand, and the first and third on the other.

l. 406. voluntariorum. Part os the predicate. Translate, ‘There
was a fresh levy and nearly all re-enlisted as volunteers.'

rescriptae entered again on the album or register.

1. 407. ad. Caudium. Cf. l. 37, n.

l. 408. Livy here uses his paints freely, in order to popularize his
story more perfectly.
