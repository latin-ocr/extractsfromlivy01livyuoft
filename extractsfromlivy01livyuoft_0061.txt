III. THE RETURN OF THE CONQUERED. 47

l. ⁴¹0· Postumii. ‘ Postumium ’ would be better Latin, as ‘ vincio ’
requires an object. But it is better to keep it as Livy has expressed it.
Translate, ‘ When the officer from respect to the consul's rank began to
bind his cords loosely.‘

quin (⁸ qui non ¹). ⁴ Why do you not draw to (“ ad '’) the knot, in
order that the surrender may be complete? ’ Cp. ‘ quin tu,’ in 1. 4²²·

l. 413. quandoque, ‘ since!

hisce: ‘his-ce‚’ ‘ his ’ being an old form of the nominative plural ;
so ‘ magistreis ' is found for ‘ magistri!

l. 414. Quiritium, not in apposition to ‘ populi? ‘ The Roman
commonwealth and the Quirites.’ So too ‘patres conscripti‚' with ‘et'
understood.

l. 415. See 400, n. ‘ Have committed a crime,' ‘ have been guilty of
, a fault? ob eam rem, quo = ‘ to the intent that?

l. 419. Childish as this sarce may seem to us, and sanatical as Livy
must have been not to have felt shame at the contrast in the Roman and
the Samnite, yet the word ‘ civem ' cau only be explained by the sact
that equal rights of citizenship had been established between the Romans
and Samnites ; that cousequently Postumius on going into exile assumed
the franchise of the Caudini. Arnold explains it, that the Caudini were
now responsible sor his actions as for those of their slaves, and, having
uo special treaty with the Romans, could not make Rome appeal to
negotiation sor redress of such a grievance. But this ignores ‘ civem?
The Samnites had not accepted the surrender of the sponsores ; Postu-
mius is putting his own construction on the matter. He assumes that
the surrender makes war ‘ just’ for the Romans, and attempts to make
it more just by this attack on the setial. Pontius naturally saw the
matter in another light.

l. 421. istam. ‘ De me loquens dicere debeo hoc caput, haec manus,
haec civitas, De te vero istud caput, ista manus, ista civitas. De tertia
autem persona illud caput, illa manus, illa civitas. Cicero in Anto-
nium: Tu istis faucibus. Et idem: Qui istinc veniunt aiunt te super·
biorem factum)

Praetically we find that ‘ hic’ and ‘iste’ are opposed, as ‘ 1' and ‘ you‚'
and ‘hic' and ‘ille‚’ as ‘near’ and ‘distant.’ And so in reference to
things previously mentioned, ‘ille ’ denotes the former or more distant,
‘hic’ the latter or nearer particular. So again in special usage: ‘ Tu si
hic sis aliter sentias,' ⁸ Were you in my place you would think otherwise.'
In lawsuits iste, ‘the man before you,’ i. e. before the ‘iudioes,' is the
opponent: hence used with a certain contempt : ille, on the other hand,
indimus a person so striking as to attract our attention in spite of
distance. In all these usages ¹ hic‚' ¹ iste,’ ‘ille ' correspond to ὅδε, οὗτος,
ἐκεῖνος respectively.
