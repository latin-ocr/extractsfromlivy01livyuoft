in whose interest also they were fighting: the Romans remorselessly
pushing on. and never losing any ground which they once had
gained. Once conquered, the territory became their οπο-ιη the in-
habitants os the dismal swamps of the Pontine Marsh, and the wild
passes of the Matese, were made to feel the grasp of the Roman gauntlet
just as tightly as the Latin tillers or the Samnite shepherds. The Via
Appia (312 ac.) was not the least clement in the greatness of purpose
and solidity of execution with which Rome held down the communes os

the Samnite consederacy. Ι

The Umbrian, or Eastern stock, os whom the Samnites were as de-
cidedly the superior people as the Latins were os the Wesoern, had
advanced towards the south of Italy, rather later than the Latins, keep-

η ing in general upon the heights, because they found the Latins in

possession of the plains. In some oeses even, as along the Apulian
coast, they had left the native population, the Iapygians, with no more
than ocoesional molestation. The banks of the rivers Sagrus and Ti-
sernus. the region of Beneventum, the frontiers of Apulia, the borders
οἱ lake Fucinus, were all secluded parts of Italy; and to this seclusion
was probably owing the growth of these people, who were thus saved
from collision with the Etruscans by Rome, with the Latins by their
mountain heights, with the Greeks by their want os seaboard. Thus,
with little or no political connection with one another. except in times
of danger from without, and in a state os complete isolation from the
rest os Italy, they had exercised no influence hitherto on the history of
the Peninsula.

It must have been long evident, however, to both Samnite and Roman,
that they would have sooner or later to contest the supremacy os Italy.
Whether the Samnites or the Romans were most aggressive on the Liris
or whether the Liris or the Greek city of Palaeopolis was the first scene
of their complications, matters little: it was quite certain that the lime-
stone —ridges of the Matese, commanding, as they did, the quickoet ap-
proach to Apulia and the South, would be an object of desire to the
Roman legions. On these hius, then, most of which rise as high as
Smsell and Helvellyn, and, clothed in beechwood foresta remind
us of the Jura range, the duel sor the leadership of Italy was being
fought, at the time when Alexander the Great was winning his battles
in Asia.
