J. SAMNITES DRIVEN TO DESPAIR. 27

but the captives, and any article which was recognized in the booty,
‘ ceterarum rerum inrita suit deditio) To this offer of restitution Pontius
refers in the following speech (Livy viii. 39).

1.,6. infecta=‘ non saeta) not from ‘ inficio!

ne here expresses the object of his speaking, not of the .‘ expiatum

est.’ Translate, ‘That you may not think we have gained nothing by
our embassy, 1 will tell you that‚’ διε, We should in English probably
break up the sentence as follows :—‘ Do not think we have gained
nothing; we have atoned sor all the divine anger which we brought on
ourselves.'

1. 7. ex foedere rupto, ‘ by the breach of the treaty.' So too
‘Ademptus Hector tradidit Pergama’; ‘the taking away of Hector
gave up Troy! In 3² 5 Β. c. the Samnites had sought sor peace, and as

. they could not agree on the terms had made a truce for a year; but

even this they did not keep, Livy viii. 37. Brutulus Papius was re-
garded as the author of the breach.

1. 9. cordi ‘ diis est‚' ‘ it is to the liking of the Gods 3 ’ ‘ they have it
at heart'

fuit, indicative, though joined to ‘ scio' by the indefinite ‘ quibus-
cunque.’ ‘Whichever of the gods had it at their beart, as 1 know full

1. 10. repeto is used of claiming, and ‘reddo’ of giving, what is

wan but we have given them up now, though they have paid their
last debt *to nature.' Notice the position of ‘auctores.' It has to do
duty as the object after ‘ dedere potuimus ' and ‘ dedidimus.' Theresore
it is put before both. In English we are obliged to use the pronoun
‘ them ² with the second verb.

l. 17. noxae depends on ‘ quid’; ‘that no taint of guilt might stay
with ns.’

penes. Adverbs are indeclinable words; sor some of them are
cases of existing nouns; others cases of lost nouns; others words with
case s'uffixes, different from those in common use in Latin ; others appa-
rently mutilated remains of some fuller expression. ‘Instar‚’ ‘ gratia,'
‘ergo' may be compared with δίκην, χάριν, ἕνεκα. ‘Penes,' ‘in the
possession os‚’ is supposed to be connected with ‘pendere.' ‘ Tenus,'
‘as far as,‘ like ‘secuS‚‘ ‘otherwise‚’ is probably an old accusative,
representing extent, from the same root as ⁴ teneo.' ‘ Ultra: ‘supra‚'
‘ infra.⁷ ‘citra,' ‘contra' are ablatives feminine singular.

1. 18. arbitris. (1) Witness, e. g. ‘remotis arbitris? f2‘s Umpire,
or person who decides a suit by equity as opposed to law. Here,
‘ witnessesss
