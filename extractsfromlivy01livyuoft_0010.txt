The history of the Latin and Samnite Wars is the counterpart of the
history of our own bordei· warfare. Dressed up in Livy's uncritical but
graphio style, the ’family tales of Rome's best blood, whilst they do not
bear upon thern the impress of candour and truth, still owe as much to
the declamation schools of the Augustan age, as the early history of
England does to Shakespeare’s dramas. The myths of Romulus and
Numa cannot but remind us of Lear and Cymbeline ; the forced oratory
of Postumius and Pontius, evidently educated in the same school of
rhetoric, recalls to us the John and Philip of our own poet; and the
scorn for the tribunes and contempt of the people which Livy's history
breathes, are as necessary to the complete development of his style as the
intemperate pride of Coriolanus and the un-Roman eloquence of Mark
Antony are indispensable to Shakespeare's Roman trilogy. It is there-
fore not surprising that Livy is best at depicting martial events like the
following; individual heroism and brilliant generosity are best seen in
the uneven flow of tempestuous scenes; the grand epic of the war with
Hannibal, and the tale of the second Samnite War must have been
read by the young Papirii and Nerones with the same zest with which
we have all read the ‘Tales of a Grandfather.’ Possibly, too, they
blushed for their countrymen‚ as they read the treatment of Pontius and
his compatrfflts, and were proud to point in preference to these latter as
the ancestors of the united empire of Italy, in the same way that English
boys extend their sympathies to William Wallace and Robert the Bruce.
The author of the ‘ Lex Plautia Papiria’ certainly did more for his
country than Papirius Cursor; and if the strong centralisation of Roman
ideas had not fettered the minds of the Augustan age of writers, Livy
might have found Pontius a more manageable hero than Postumius.

The few chapters reprinted in the following pages narrate the most
striking events in the Samnite War, a contest which, lasting full fifty
years (343-290 nc), was only intermpted by occasional truces, and may
be fairly styled the heroic age of Rome. The struggle with Veii about
fifty years before ( 39 5 B.C.) was the first occasion on which the Romans
organized a standing army and paid their troops. The subjugation
of the Samnites now, heralded by the dissolution of the Latin conse·
deracy (340 Bc). was the first step to the Italian empire. ⁶ Maiora

certainly the perseverance of the Samnites. the generalship and tactics
which they brought into the field, merit this preface. Both sides aimed
at each othcr's hearts. the Samnites indeed with n strange want of
settled purpose, and not sufficicntly assisted by the other nationalities
