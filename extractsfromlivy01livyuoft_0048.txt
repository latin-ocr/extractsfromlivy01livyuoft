the preservation is finally given in 1. 123, ‘multiplices poenas expe-
titas a vobis.’ Expressed as a condition the meaning would be—‘If
you keep thern alive, their nature is such that they will have their
revenge, and you will pay for your victory many times over.' For
a similarly graphic form of expression and bearing on the same subject
see Horace, Odes, iv. 4. 65-68 ε
‘Merses profundo: pulchrior evenit:
Luctere: multa proruet integrum
Cum laude victorem, geretque
Proelia coniugibus loquenda.'

1. 122. praesens, ‘special, immediate need! The whole of this
speech is more like the style of Hor. Od. iv. 4 than sober prose.

1. 12 5. domum. Dr. Abbott, in his Latin Prose remarks that ‘in
English the object after a verb of motion osten dispenses with the
preposition. Thus we say, “He went home‚'' “I go fisbing.’' Where
the preposition is not quite discarded, the tendency is sometimes seen,
as in “ He rides a-field.‘’ All nouns that are osten repeated aster the
same preposition in English have a tendency to become adverbs. Thus
we say “abed '' but not “ achair,’' “ asleep ” but not “ aslumber.’' Now
the Romans thought more os towns and less of countries than we do.
Farmers used to live in the towns and go out to their work. So, as
they were constantly going into and out of their houses, their fields,
and their towns, but not so often into and out of countries, they omitted
prepositions before towns, but retained them before countriesl See
however note on l. 37, where a somewhat different explanation is
given. Dr. Abbott hardly allows enough for the fact that a town is
a definite spot, whereas a country is a large tract into which one
goes.

1. 127. eapti. ‘ Suscipio ‘ would be more usual.

l. 128. Notice the final use of qm', ‘to seek.'

l. 129. provocarent. All this is part of Livy's school declamation
style. For uti compare note on l. 40. It seems better to take ‘uti‘
as introducing tha instructions of the Romans to the embassy in oblique
petition, than as carrying on the final idea in ‘quil Translate, ‘Is
they saw no chance os obtaining peace, they were to challenge thern
to a battle!

1. 130. debellatum esse, impersonal : ‘all war was over?

1. 132. alias, ‘in all other respects! Pontius insisted on the con-
fession of defeat implied by passing under the ‘ iugum ’ς when this was
done, he would propose sair terms.

l. 133. agro. See note on 1. 96. The absence of the preposition
here probably represents the act as implying the relinquishment os any
claim on the land as well as possession os it.
