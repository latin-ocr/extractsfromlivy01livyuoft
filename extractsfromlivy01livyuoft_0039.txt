1. SAMNITES DRIVEN TO DESPAIR.
TRANSLA'HON OF umas 1-34·

We now come to the consulate eff Τ. Veturius Calvinus and Spurius
Postumius, the year ff the famous defeat of the Romans which led to the
peace of Caudium. The leader of the Samnites was G. Pontius, the
son of Herennius, and as the father was the greatest statesman, so was
the son the most distinguished soldier and general of his day. When
the envoys, who had been sent to Rome to make restitution‚ returned
wth the report that peace was not to be had, ⁴ You must not suppose:
said Pontius to the Samnites, ⁸ that the embassy has been sent in vain ,-

offence is now expiated. T hose gods, whoever they were, whose will it
was that we should be reduced to the necessity (ᾖ meeting the demands
fir restitution in accordance with the terms of the peace, will, I am sure,
look with displeasure on the Romam thus haughtily refusing· the pros-
sered expiation. that can be done more than we have done to appense
the wrath os gods and men? we have sent back properly which was
captured as spoil, and lausul prize of war ; when we could no longer
sur-render the authors of the war alive, we gave up their dead bodies,-
we carried their property to Rome that no stain ofguilt might be lest
among us. What debt remaim unpaid to you, Roman ? When more
is· due to the treaty and the gods in whose presence it was made ? that
ampire shall l offer to settle the measure of your anger and my punish-
ment? I shrink from no one, whether a nation or an indivulual.
But isamong men the helpless has no longer any rights in his stncggle
with the powerful, I will betake mysels to the gods who punish the proud
spirit, and implore them to turn their wrath on those who are content
