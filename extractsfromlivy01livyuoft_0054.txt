ΙΙΙ, THE RETURN OF THE CONQUERED.

The Roman people are thus pledged by the Roman army to accept
a peace which can only be humiliating to them. Every step which the
conquered take towards Rome serves only to reveal to thern the
enormity os their cowardice. No attentions on the part of their allies
can soothe their wounded pride; no mouming seems adequate to the
Roman Senate; the loss in battle, the captivity of six hundred of the
flower of their youth, seem as nothing compared with the disgrace of
such a peace. Sp. Postumius, who had sworn to reeommend the treaty,
comes forward as its chief denouncer, and, regardless of all personal
feeling and honour, thinks only how his countrymen can evade the
obligations under which he himself has placed them. Yet, if he meant
anything by his oath to Pontius, he ought to have meant that he would
do his best to further the treaty. For this consult Arnold’s Hislory of
Rome, vol. ii. p. 224.
