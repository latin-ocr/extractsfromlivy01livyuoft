INTRODUCTION.

Tus series os which this little volume forms the first instalment is
meant to illustrate the principal features os Rome's external history, and
of Livy's manner ot' dealing with it. The Caudine Disaster‚ Hannibal's
Campaign in Italy, and the Roman Subjugation os Macedonia, are typical
events in the three periods of the history of the Roman republic—the

· struggle for dominion over Italy, sor dominion over the Western

Seas, sor dominion over the civilised world. Papirius, Hannibal, and
Aemilius are characters worth studying. And though as treated by
Livy it cannot be denied that there is a certain sameness in the rheto-
riml manner in which they all express their views, this is not a fault
of style so much as of the age in which he lived. We mn easily excuse
where we are so deeply interested. Livy's narrative, glowing with all the
colours os fancy, can no more deceive us into mistaking it sor a page
of history, than we could mistake Henry V in Shakespeare sor Henry V
in Holinshed. In writing. his main object is to be effective. He shows
causes only so sar as they help to give colour to a deductiori which
he has already drawn in his own mind, and chooses his facts only as
materials sor eloquence. Is we want to find the philosophy of history as
conceived by Livy, we must look in the discourses. The bitter regrets
expressed by the conquered nations, as they felt the yoke contain our
historian's views as to why they were conquered; the exhortations os the
generals as they led their men into the field are as much addressed to the
Romans of the Augustan age as they could have been to the practical
yeomen os earlier times; the broken heart os a Hannibal pours out its
laments against the imbecility of the home-government as the Greeks
os old times told out their dreams to the sun.

And so too with his narrative. The oratorical clement never deserts
him. As M. Taine has well remarked, if we read only six lines of Livy,
involuntarily our voice gets louder, our tones more argumentative; we
defend a cause; we deliver an harangue.

Less diffuse than Herodotus, less measured than Xenophon, less
manly than Caesar, less critical than Thucydides. Livy stands in a place
os his own ; he is the orator-historian.
