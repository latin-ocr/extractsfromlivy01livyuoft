Ill. THE RETURN OF THE CONQUERED. 43

l. 307. iustum piumque, ‘without violating any laws human or
divine.'

1. 309. placet. ‘my view is!

1. 310. omnia iusta. ‘all that they can fairly claim.'

1. 313. at voe. &c.‚ ‘still to consider it sufficient to have seen us sent
under the yoke‚ to have seen us bound by a dishonourable agreement,
and now (“ videre '’) to see us handed over in chains and naked to the
enemy, sustaining all the anger of the soe on our own heads.'

habeatis and velitis are subjunctives dependent on ‘ precor quaeso-
que ' in oblique petition.

1. 317. ante noe consules, ‘before our consulship) It may be
here remarked that the result os the first Samnite War was by no means
so onesided as Postumius is made to imply. See note on l. 85.

. 1. 3²2· etiam. Translate, ‘ Thongh a man of such worth, he was
actually to suffer the worst punishment.'

l. 323. ob iram, ‘ as he was sure to suffer from their anger at the
breaking off of the peace?

l. 3²4· prosequentes (cp. ‘ prosequor te beneficiis ’), ‘ attending him
with nothing but praises.‘

l. 325. pedibus. ‘ Ire pedibus' is the technical term sor voting in
a division. Translate, ‘ Were just adopting his resolution.'

1. 327. aua. If the tribunes of the people were to be given up, they
must have been in some way implicated in making the peace. If they
were in the army at the time, they must have been sent on some special
mission, sor as a rule a tribune was not allowed to leave the city for
a night, or they must have come into office since they made the peace.
Another suggestion is that they either sanctioned a decree of the curies
about the peace, or made a formal proposal to that effect. Possibly
the peace was ratified to recover the hostages. Livy, however, makes
out that they were recovered in the year following at Luceria: this is
improbable, as they would surely have been massacred on the breaking
of the peace. If the tribunes had ratified the peace, there is little
excuse sor the Romans. Otherwise it was quite an established principle
that at 'Rome every state agreement, not purely military, pertained to
the civil authorities, and a general who concluded peace without the
instruction of the senate exceeded his powers. After all, treaties are as
osten mere acknowledgments of a pressing necessity as they are moral
obligations.

Of course Livy wishes us to contrast the conduct of the consuls and
the tribunes of the plebs. But, however we take it, it is obvious that
the story is more or less garbled.

l. 330. ad extremum, ‘ finally!

l. 33²- interea, ‘meanwhile‚ till this question is settled*
