os bodily motion, but ‘ abscessit incepto,' ‘he gave up the undertaking?
Similarly ‘ abstraho milites de imperatoris conspectn‚’ but ‘ abstraho me

l. 97. affecto, ‘ weakened.‘

l. 102. consulebatur. The subject to this verb is ‘ Herennius
Pontius,⁸ not ‘sententia.’ Lower down, in 1. 106, the subject to ‘vietus
