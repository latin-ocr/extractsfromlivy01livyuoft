III. THE RETURN OF THE CONQUERED. 41

1. 234. super, &c.‚ ‘independently of their desire to show their
moumrng.'

1. 236. s capua. ‘Ab' is sometimes (by Livy usually) prefixed to
the names of towns in the sense of removal, and always when removal
from the neighbourhood is indicated, as ⁴ Caesar a Gergovia discessit,'
or when ‘urbs' or ‘oppidum’ precedes the name. Compare note on

1. 238. multo . . . retulerunt, ‘reported them to be much more
gloomy and disheartened than the day before?

1. 239. adeo . . . incessisse, ‘so silent, they said, nay almost asir
dumb-stricken, had the column stalked along!

1. 240. iacere, ‘ was prostrate!

l. 243. quemquam. See note ou 1. 159.

l. 244. habere . . . perpetuam, ‘the Samnites had in their hands
a victor-y as lasting in its effects as in its same.' Notice the force of
‘habere' as more real than ⁶ Samnitibus esse' would be.

l. 248. deploratum, ‘ wept for as lost.’

1. 251. So Cicero osten, ‘Sic profecto se res habet’; ‘The truth is
sar otherwise)

l. ²5²- illud, oratio obliqua sor ‘ istud.' Translate, ‘ That set silence
you notice, those eyes fixed on the ground, those ears deas to all consola-
tion, that shame at seeing the light—all these are only signs of a mind
gathering a mass os passion from its depths'

obstinatum, ‘ set.’

1. 254. ex alto, ‘ alto ’ is=a substantive: animi with ¹indicia,‘ but
the word may be repeated in sense with ‘ alto.'

1. 258. quippe= ‘qui-pte‚' as ἅτε; ‘ because forsooth‚‘ ‘ in fact? Trans-
late, ‘ The fact was that each party would bring their own temper with
thern wherever they might meet, whilst the Samnites would not find
a pass of Caudium everywhere)

For the singular quemque, see note ou l. 46.

l. 261. sua reflexive on ‘Romae¹ But this reference os ‘suus' to an
object case is only possible where the sense is obvious. See Public
School Grammar, 5 87.

intumis, ⁶ notorious!
1. 263. periculi, keep the alliteration with ‘ pacis'; ‘peril.'
magis is not to be taken with ‘ tristior,’ where it would be super-
fluous: ‘the next message was more disheartening, as it spoke of a
sbamesul peace rather than peril?

l. 264. coeptus erat. Passive with a passive verb ‘ dependent) So
too with a passive infinitive we find both ‘ desieram’ and ‘ desitus sum.¹

auxiliorum, ‘reinsorcementsl

l. 266. ulls. See note on 1. 159.
